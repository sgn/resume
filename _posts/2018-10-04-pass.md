I've started to use [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/)
([ArchWiki article](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/pass))
to manage my password.

IMHO, this tool is far better than other password manager that I've used.
The reasons are listed here, in no particular order:

- It's easy to use with cli, and dmenu. It has some GUI tools, but I haven't
  tried, yet. The Android one is very good to my need, though.
- `pass` uses one file per entry, with `git` intergration, it's easy to
  synchronise password between multiple devices, check password history.
  We'll just need to set up a central git repository in local computer with:
```
# init common repository
mkdir ~/.cache/pass.git && git -C ~/.cache/pass.git init --bare
```
Then, we can do normal git workflow with the repo, whenever we make some changes
into the tracked password store, `pass` will automatically commit the change
into git. Of course, we can clone directly from `~/.password-store/git`, but
it's harder to push back the change to the computer.
- passwords are generated and encrypted by `gpg`. It's not that hard to setup
  your `gpg` key-pairs.
